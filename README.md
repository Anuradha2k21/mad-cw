Ardroid studio 23.2.1 patch 1

min SDK 24 (tested on android 9 and 13)

create a new branch before you push your code

use usb debugging or wireless debugging if possible instead of using emulator. but you need an android device.

let me know if you got any gradle conflict errors. usually android studio automatically download and installs any new gradle versions.

IMPORTANT: you'd have to edit gmail credentials in UserConfirmation.java file. otherwise whole app some other parts of the app might not run correctly.
